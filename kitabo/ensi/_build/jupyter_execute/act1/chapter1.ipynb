    "**The Deluge of Unstructured Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clinical medicine has always been data-rich, but with the widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHR) following the Affordable Care Act, the nature of this data has changed profoundly. What was once confined to handwritten notes, local systems, and fragmented records has become a torrent of unstructured, digital information. This transformation is both a blessing and a curse. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data, vast and varied, is our first R—**resources**. It contains everything: patient histories, lab results, imaging studies, and even narrative observations from clinicians. This ocean of information is tempestuous, like the Dionysian chaos of life itself. The unstructured nature of the data, while rich with potential, presents immediate challenges. Without a way to organize, interpret, and extract meaning, the sheer volume of information overwhelms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unstructured data is paradoxical: a goldmine locked behind layers of noise and disorganization. Yet, this very abundance makes the data a transformative resource. By engaging with it—not as a burden but as a foundational element—we take the first step toward clarity. In this chapter, we explore how this deluge came to be, its implications for clinical medicine, and why the raw resource is the most important input layer in our R³ model.\n",
